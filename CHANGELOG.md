## 2025-12-10
- Security & CSP
  - Updated Terraform defaults (`csp_prod`, `csp_staging`) so `script-src` explicitly allows `'unsafe-inline'`. Astro’s client islands inject inline bootstrap code; without this allowance, hydration was blocked in production and pages stayed stuck in the static “syncing” shell.
  - Documented the trade-offs in the README security section and reminded operators to keep data fetches flowing through `/api/*` so `connect-src` can remain `'self'`. If you override `csp`, carry forward the inline allowance or add a nonce/hash through Cloudflare transform rules before tightening.
- Verification
  - `npm run smoke` still fails against `https://stacknews.org` until the new CSP is applied in Cloudflare (current live headers still use the older script policy). Re-run the script after applying Terraform to confirm feeds and treasury endpoints respond with `_cache` metadata again.

## 2025-12-09
- Config & Deployability
  - Moved Cloudflare Pages bindings management to `wrangler.toml` because the dashboard reported: "Bindings for this project are being managed through wrangler.toml." This ensures reproducible, source‑controlled deployments and prevents drift.
  - Added Service Binding in code: `COORDINATOR -> stacknews-coordinator` (environment: production).
  - Added KV binding in code: `STACKNEWS_KV -> 8f9f004bf39a4e92ac3c21ebf1545d68`.
  - Redeployed production (Pages) so Functions pick up the bindings.
  - Aligned Wrangler compatibility date across files to `2024-12-01` (avoid runtime drift). Kept `wrangler.toml:name = "stacknews"` and Pages project `wrangler.jsonc:name = "stacknews-astro"` (documented in README).
  - Removed environment pin from COORDINATOR service binding in `wrangler.toml` to use the Worker's default environment and avoid mismatches when named envs aren’t configured.
- Rationale
  - Remove reliance on manual dashboard configuration, reduce misconfig risk, and keep infra changes reviewed via PR.
  - Replace the old `COORDINATOR_URL` public fallback with a private Service Binding for lower latency and no public attack surface.
    - Security & Headers
  - Confirmed Response Header Transform rules via Terraform and re‑captured the live ruleset in `scripts/security-headers.live.json`.
  - Introduced canonical Terraform ruleset for zone‑level headers under `infrastructure/terraform/cloudflare/` with HSTS, Referrer‑Policy, X‑Frame‑Options, X‑Content‑Type‑Options, and Permissions‑Policy. Optional CSP controlled via variables.
  - Added `scripts/fetch-security-headers-live.mjs` and `npm run headers:snapshot` to fetch the latest applied ruleset into `scripts/security-headers.live.json` for drift detection.
  - Tightened CSP defaults and made them environment‑aware:
    - Variables: `environment` (production|staging|development), `csp_mode` (enforce|report-only|disabled), `enable_csp` toggle, and explicit `csp` override.
        - Defaults: strict `csp_prod` (enforce), near‑prod `csp_staging` (report‑sample), permissive `csp_dev` (dev tooling).
    - Coordinator & Feeds Reliability
      - Pages Functions now include `X-Stacknews-Warm` when calling the coordinator via the `COORDINATOR` service binding (auth alignment with Worker).
      - When the coordinator is unavailable, `/api/feeds.json?category=ALL` now refreshes at least one category (fallback to the first in rotation) to avoid empty payloads.
    - Treasury Yield Curve Resilience
      - Added retry/backoff (3 attempts, exponential) for upstream FiscalData calls.
      - Increased KV TTL for snapshots to 24h and added `Cache-Control` on KV fallbacks; KV-backed responses are also written into the HTTP cache.
    - UI Behavior (No Fake Data)
      - Removed all loading/placeholder texts (e.g., “SYNCING…”, “LOADING…”, “NO DATA”). Panels and widgets only render when real data is available.
      - Sidebar “National Debt” renders only with a non‑zero value; feed panels render only with actual items.
- Feeds & Categories
  - Added US Civil Air Patrol feeds (News, Cadet Blogs, Learning Videos, STEM Lessons) under `MILITARY`.
  - Added country/region categories: `BULGARIA`, `CHINA`, `AFRICA` and wired into rotation.
  - Added feeds: Bulgarian Military (RSS), China Defense Blog (RSS), Africa Defense News (RSS).
  - Not added due to missing/uncertain RSS endpoints: China Military Aviation (incomplete URL), China Military Official (site URL provided without RSS). Provide valid RSS/Atom URLs to include.
 - Dev Ergonomics & Docs
   - Added `.nvmrc` (Node v20.18.0) and `"engines"` in `package.json` for reproducible builds.
   - Added `.dev.vars.example` (FRED_API_KEY, NASA_API_KEY, EIA_API_KEY, WARM_SECRET) and ignored `.dev.vars` in VCS.
   - Added `scripts/verify-env.mjs` + `npm run env:verify` (checks required secrets and Wrangler config: COORDINATOR, STACKNEWS_KV, nodejs_compat).
   - Added `scripts/smoke.mjs` + `npm run smoke` to validate key endpoints and security headers. Supports `SMOKE_ORIGIN` override.
   - Clarified README: local dev quickstart, KV namespace discovery command, Wrangler names/compatibility dates, coordinator noted as Cloudflare‑managed, rollback guidance.

## 2025-12-08
- Deployment
  - Deployed coordinator Worker (Durable Object) to workers.dev and set WARM_SECRET.
  - Set Pages secrets: NASA_API_KEY, EIA_API_KEY, WARM_SECRET (FRED_API_KEY already present).
  - Resolved Pages deployment error (MessageChannel not defined) by pinning React/React-DOM to 18.3.x.
  - Added nodejs_compat for Pages in wrangler.jsonc.
- Security & Caching
  - Added Cloudflare Cache API read/write for `/api/feeds.json` and `/api/treasury.json` with SWR + `stale-if-error`.
  - Introduced KV read-through/write-through for feed items, category aggregates, and treasury fallback.
  - Added HMAC protection (`WARM_SECRET`) for scheduled warm requests.
- Coordination & Warmups
  - Added Durable Object coordinator Worker and Service Binding in Pages.
  - Implemented scheduled warmers (feeds rotation + JSON APIs) with jitter.
- Feeds
  - Added TreasuryDirect auctions/offerings, EIA RSS, World Nuclear News, CleanTechnica, Hydrogen Central.
  - Added Mortgage & Real Estate sources (MND, Fannie, Freddie, Redfin, Realtor.com, Connect CRE, NAR).
  - Added international central bank feeds (BoE news, BoC press, CBR press) and research feeds (arXiv, LLNL, ORNL, MIT Energy).
- JSON APIs
  - New endpoints: `/api/treasury-fiscal.json`, `/api/eia.json`, `/api/census/housing.json`, `/api/nasa/solar.json`, `/api/gdelt/events.json`, `/api/ukdata/search.json`.
  - Added `/api/treasury/yield-curve.json` (FiscalData Daily Yield Curve) with Cache API + KV fallback.
- Performance & Reliability
  - Implemented per-host concurrency limiter and backoff (429 Retry-After, 5xx exponential) for feed fetching.
  - Removed public proxy fallbacks from Yahoo market data; route via internal edge proxy only.
- Secrets & Config
  - Removed hardcoded `FRED_API_KEY`; read from Pages secrets.
  - Added env usage for `NASA_API_KEY` and `EIA_API_KEY`.
  - Removed `COORDINATOR_URL` fallback; Pages must bind `COORDINATOR` service to `stacknews-coordinator` Worker.
- Security Headers
  - Prepared Transform Rules script and ruleset for HSTS, CSP, nosniff, referrer-policy, frame-ancestors, permissions-policy.
  - See transcript for step-by-step: docs/transcripts/stacknews-session-2025-12-08.md
  - Captured live Cloudflare ruleset schema after applying via Dashboard: scripts/security-headers.live.json (source of truth for future API updates).
